reportWebVitals is a utility function provided by Create React App that helps you measure and report the performance of your web 
application using Web Vitals metrics. Web Vitals is an initiative by Google to provide unified guidance for quality signals that 
are essential to delivering a great user experience on the web. The main Web Vitals metrics are:

Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): Measures the loading performance of your app. To provide a good user experience, LCP should occur 
within 2.5 seconds of when the page first starts loading.

First Input Delay (FID): Measures interactivity, specifically the time from when a user first interacts with a page to the time
when the browser can begin processing event handlers in response to that interaction. A good FID is less than 100 milliseconds.

Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS): Measures visual stability, quantifying how much elements on the page shift during loading. 
A good CLS score is less than 0.1.
